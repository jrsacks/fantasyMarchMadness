Small Sinatra App to scrape college basketball scores from Yahoo to allow for fantasy basketball.

Start the server by running 
  $ ruby lib/fantasyMarchMadness.rb

Once running, add teams by posting valid JSON to /team

  $ curl -d '{"team":"first team","players":[]} localhost:4567/team

Load teams by doing a get with the team id

  $ curl localhost:4567/players/wbg

The team id is what Yahoo Sports uses in their team links.
Basically they are the 3 letter abbreviations for each team off this page:
  http://rivals.yahoo.com/ncaa/basketball/teams

Once teams are loaded, data can be updated via boxscore id or using the date.

  $ curl localhost:4567/game/201202260443/
or
  $ curl localhost:4567/date/2012-02-26

Using the date will load all games for that date.  Careful not to hit yahoo too often, they do not like that.

Standings page will be index.html  Going to teams.html allows easy editing and adding of players to teams.  There is autocomplete for all players that have been loaded.

Cron is your friend when setting a schedule for when to update games.
